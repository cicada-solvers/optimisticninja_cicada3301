									Without Contraries is no progression. Attraction and Repulsion, Reason and Energy, Love and Hate, are necessary to Human existence.<br>

									1. That Man has two real existing principles Viz: a Body &amp; a Soul.<br>
									2. That Energy, call'd Evil, is alone from the Body, &amp; that Reason, call'd Good, is alone from the Soul.<br>
									3. That God will torment Man in Eternity for following his Energies.<br>
									<br>
									But the following Contraries to these are True.<br>
									1. Man has no Body distinct from his Soul; for that call'd Body is a portion of Soul discern'd by the five Senses, the chief inlets of Soul in this age.<br>
									2. Energy is the only life and is from the Body and Reason is the bound or outward circumference of Energy.<br>

									<br>
									The history of this written in Paradise Lost, &amp; the Governor of Reason is call'd Messiah.<br>
									<br>
									And the original Archangel or possessor of the command of the heavenly host, is call'd the Devil or Satan and his children are call'd Sin &amp; Death.<br>

									But in the Book of Job Miltons Messiah is call'd Satan.<br>
									<br>
									For this history has been adopted by both parties.<br>
									<br>
									It indeed appear'd to Reason as if Desire was cast out, but the Devils account is that the Messiah <a href="http://www.gailgastfield.com/mhh/mhh6.jpg">(Plate 6)</a> fell, &amp; formed a heaven of what he stole from the Abyss.<br>
									<br>
									This is shewn in the Gospel, where he prays to the Father to send the comforter or Desire that Reason may have Ideas to build on, the Jehovah of the Bible being no other than he who dwells in flaming fire.<br>

							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">Then I asked: does a firm perswasion that a thing is so, make it so?</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">He replied, All poets that it does, &amp; in ages of imagination this firm perswasion removed mountains; but many are not capable of a firm perswasion of any thing.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">Then Ezekiel said, The philosophy of the east taught the first principles of human perception: some nations held one principle for the origin &amp; some another; we of Israel taught that the Poetic Genius (as you now call it) was the first principle and all other others merely derivative, which was the cause of our despising the priests &amp; Philosophers of other countries, and prophecying that all Gods (<a href="http://www.gailgastfield.com/mhh/mhh13.jpg">Plate 13)</a> would at last be proved to originate in ours &amp; to be the tributaries of the Poetic Genius; it was this that our great poet King David desired so fervently &amp; invokes so patheticly, saying by this he conquers enemies &amp; governs kingdoms; and we so loved our God, that we cursed in his name all deities of surrounding nations, and asserted that they had rebelled; from these opinions the vulgar came to think that all nations would at last be subject to the jews.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">This said he, like all firm perswasions, is come to pass, for all nations believe the jews code and worship the jews god, and what greater subjection can be?<br>
									I heard this with some wonder, &amp; must confess my own conviction. After dinner I ask'd Isaiah to favour the world with his lost works, he said none of equal value was lost. Ezekiel said the same of his.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">I also asked Isaiah what made him go naked and barefoot three years? he answer'd, the same that made our friend Diogenes the Grecian.</font></p>

							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">My friend the Angel climb'd up from his station into the mill; I remain'd alone, &amp; then this appearance was no more, but I found myself sitting on a pleasant bank beside a river by moonlight hearing a harper who sung to the harp, &amp; his theme was, The man who never alters his opinion is like standing water, &amp; breeds reptiles of the mind.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">But I arose, and sought for the mill &amp; there I found my Angel, who surprised asked me how I escaped?</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">I answer'd, All that we saw was owing to your metaphysics; for when you ran away, I found myself on a bank by moonlight hearing a harper. But now we have seen my eternal lot, shall I shew you yours? he laugh'd at my proposal; but I by force suddenly caught him in my arms, &amp; flew westerly thro' the night, till we were elevated above the earths shadow; then I flung myself with him directly into the body of the sun; here I clothed myself in white, &amp; taking in my hand Swedenborgs volumes, sunk from the glorious clime, and passed all the planets till we came to saturn; here I staid to rest, &amp; then leap'd into the void, between saturn &amp; the fixed stars.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">Here, said I! is your lot, in this space, if space it may be call'd. Soon we saw the stable and the church, &amp; I took him to the altar and open'd the Bible, and lo! it was a deep pit, into which I descended driving the Angel before me; soon we saw seven houses of brick; one we enter'd; in it were a <a href="http://www.gailgastfield.com/mhh/mhh20.jpg">(Plate 20)</a> number of monkeys, baboons, &amp; all of that species, chain'd by the middle, grinning and snatching at one another, but witheld by the shortness of their chains; however I saw that they sometimes grew numerous, and then the weak were caught by the strong, and with a grinning aspect, first coupled with &amp; then devour'd, by plucking off first one limb and then another till the body was left a helpless trunk; this after grinning &amp; kissing it with seeming fondness they devour'd too; and here &amp; there I saw one savourily picking the flesh off of his own tail; as the stench terribly annoy'd us both we went into the mill, &amp; I in my hand brought the skeleton of a body, which in the mill was Aristotles Analytics.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">So the Angel said: thy phantasy has imposed upon me &amp; thou oughtest to be ashamed.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">I answer'd: we impose on one another, &amp; it is but lost time to converse with you whose works are only Analytics.</font></p>

							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">I have always found that Angels have the vanity to speak of themselves as the only wise; this they do with a confident insolence sprouting from systematic reasoning:</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">Thus Swedenborg boasts that what he writes is new; tho' it is only the Contents or Index of already publish'd books.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">A man carried a monkey about for a shew, &amp; because he was a little wiser than the monkey, grew vain, and conciev'd himself as much wiser than seven men. It is so with Swedenborg; he shews the folly of churches &amp; exposes hypocrites, till he imagines that all are religious, &amp; himself the single <a href="http://www.gailgastfield.com/mhh/mhh22.jpg">(Plate 22)</a> one on earth that ever broke a net.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">Now hear a plain fact: Swedenborg has not written one new truth:<br>
									Now hear another: he has written all the old falshoods.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">And now hear the reason. He conversed with Angels who are all religious, &amp; conversed not with Devils who all hate religion, for he was incapable thro' his conceited notions.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">Thus Swedenborgs writings are a recapitulation of all superficial, opinions, and an analysis of the more sublime, but no further.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">Have now another plain fact: Any man of mechanical talents may from the writings of Paracelsus or Jacob Behmen, produce ten thousand volumes of equal value with Swedenborgs, and from those of Dante or Shakespear, an infinite number.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">But when he has done this, let him not say that he knows better than his master, for he only holds a candle in sunshine.</font></p>

							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">Once I saw a Devil in a flame of fire, who arose before an Angel that sat on a cloud, and the Devil utter'd these words.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">The worship of God is, Honouring his gifts in other men each according to his genius, and loving the greatest <a href="http://www.gailgastfield.com/mhh/mhh23.jpg">(Plate 23)</a> men best; those who envy or calumniate great men hate God, for there is no other God.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">The Angel hearing this became almost blue, but mastering himself he grew yellow, &amp; at last white pink &amp; smiling, and then replied,</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">Thou Idolater, is not God One? &amp; is not he visible in Jesus Christ? and has not Jesus Christ given his sanction to the law often commandments, and are not all other men fools, sinners, &amp; nothings?</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">The Devil answer'd: bray a fool in a morter with wheat, yet shall not his folly be beaten out of him; if Jesus Christ is the greatest man, you ought to love him in the greatest degree; now hear how he has given his sanction to the law of ten commandments: did he not mock at the sabbath, and so mock the sabbaths God? murder those who were murder'd because of him? turn away the law from the woman taken in adultery? steal the labor of others to support him? bear false witness when he omitted making a defence before Pilate? covet when he pray'd for his disciples, and when he bid them shake off the dust of their feet against such as refused to lodge them? I tell you, no virtue can exist without breaking these ten commandments; Jesus was all virtue, and acted from impulse, <a href="http://www.gailgastfield.com/mhh/mhh24.jpg">(Plate 24)</a> not from rules.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">When he had so spoken: I beheld the Angel who stretched out his arms embracing the flame of fire, &amp; he was consumed and arose as Elijah.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">Note. This Angel, who is now become a Devil, is my particular friend; we often read the Bible together in its infernal or diabolical sense which the world shall have if they behave well.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, serif, Times, Bookman">I have also: The Bible of Hell: which the world shall have whether they will or no.</font></p>
