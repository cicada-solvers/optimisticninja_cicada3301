This is from another unknown

```
**** realized that some of the numbers looked like the filenames we’d tried, and so he went to work checking them out. I wgeted all of them.

About 2-4 afters after I grabbed them, the DNS entry for 845145127.com was changed to 127.0.0.1, and the previous IP (75.119.203.244) stopped responding to pings and TCP SYNs.

At this point, our story takes a darker turn. Our elite IRC group of ** people deceived the rest, and led them on a wild goose chase. We created a branch off the puzzle, and led them solving unsolvable things. We distracted them so we would progress and they would not. We’re sorry to announce that, but it’s a necessary part of the story.

For those that missed round one completely: — ends with 3301 sending out emails.
From here, a fellow named **** (not our ****) posted the URL 1853143003544.tk in a chat room on n0v4, which was the sum of the largest number in each group here. Each group is the larger number, prime factored. The TXT record for that URL said “Go to my largest part”. The largest prime factor of 1853143003544 is 33091839349, so we went to 33091839349.tk. This site had no TXT, but contained HTML with a black background and this image:
