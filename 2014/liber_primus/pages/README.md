A  KOAN
A  MAN  DECIDED  TO  GO  AND  STUDY  WITH  A  MASTER

HE  WENT  TO  THE  DOOR  OF  THE  MASTER

"WHO  ARE  YOU  WHO  WISHES  TO  STUDY  HERE"  ASKED  THE  MASTER

THE  STUDENT  TOLD  THE  MASTER  HIS  NAME

"THAT  IS  NOT  WHO  YOU  ARE,  THAT  IS  ONLY  WHAT  YOU  ARE  CALLED

WHO  ARE  YOU  WHO  WISHES  TO  STUDY  HERE"  HE  ASKE

```

D  AGAIN
THE  MAN  THOUGHT  FOR  A  MOMENT,  AND  REPLIED  "I  AM  A  PROFESSOR"

"THAT  IS  WHAT  YOU  DO,  NOT  WHO  YOU  ARE,"  REPLIED  THE  MASTER

"WHO  ARE  YOU  WHO  WISHES  TO  STUDY  HERE"

CONFUSED,  THE  MAN  THOUGHT  SOME  MORE

FINALLY,  HE  ANSWERED,  "I  AM  A  HUMAN  BEING"

"THAT  IS  ONLY  YOUR  SPECIES,  NOT  WHO  YOU  ARE

WH

```


[Page 8](img/08.jpg)

```

O  ARE  YOU  WHO  WISHES  TO  STUDY  HERE",  ASKED  THE  MASTER  AGAIN
AFTER  A  MOMENT  OF  THOUGHT,  THE  PROFESSOR  REPLIED  "I  AM  A  CONSCIOUSNESS  INHABITING  AN  ARBITRARY  BODY"

"THAT  IS  MERELY  WHAT  YOU  ARE,  NOT  WHO  YOU  ARE

WHO  ARE  YOU  WHO  WISHES  TO  STUDY  HERE"

THE  MAN  WAS  GETTING  IRRITATED

"I  AM,"  HE  STARTED

```


[Page 9](img/09.jpg)

```

BUT  HE  COULD  NOT  THINK  OF  ANYTHING  ELSE  TO  SAY,  SO  HE  TRAILED  OFF
AFTER  A  LONG  PAUSE  THE  MASTER  REPLIED,  "THEN  YOU  ARE  WELCOME  TO  COME  STUDY"

AN  INSTRUCTION

DO  FOUR  UNREASONABLE  THINGS  EACH  DAY

```


[Page 10](img/10.jpg)

```

THE  LOSS  OF  DIVINITY
THE  CIRCUMFERENCE  PRACTICES  THREE  BEHAVIORS  WHICH  CAUSE  THE  LOSS  OF  DIVINITY

CONSUMPTION

WE  CONSUME  TOO  MUCH  BECAUSE  WE  BELEIVE  THE  FOLLWING  TWO  ERRORS  WITHIN  THE  DECEPTION

1    WE  DO  NOT  HAVE  ENOUGH,  OR  THERE  IS  NOT  ENOUGH

```

[Page 11](img/11.jpg)

```

2    WE  HAVE  WHAT  WE  HAVE  NOW  BY  LUCK;  AND  WE  WILL  NOT  BE  STRONG  ENOUGH  LATER  TO  OBTAIN  WHAT  WE  NEED
MOST  THINGS  ARE  NOT  WORTH  CONSUMING

PRESERVATION

WE  PRESERVE  THINGS  BECAUSE  WE  BELIEVE  WE  ARE  WEAK

IF  WE  LOSE  THEM  WE  WILL  NOT  BE  STRONG  ENOUGH  TO  GAIN  THEM  AGAIN

THIS  IS  THE  DECEPTION

```

[Page 12](img/12.jpg)

```

MOST THINGS ARE NOT WORTH PRESERVING
ADHERENCE

WE  FOLLOW  DOGMA  SO  THAT  WE  CAN  BELONG  AND  BE  RIGHT;  OR  WE  FOLLOW  REASON  SO  WE  CAN  BELONG  AND  BE  RIGHT

THERE  IS  NOTHING  TO  BE  RIGHT  ABOUT;  TO  BELONG  IS  DEATH

IT  IS  THE  BEHAVIORS  OF  CONSUMPTION,  PRESERVATION,  AND  ADHEREN

```

[Page 13](img/13.jpg)

```

CE  THAT  HAVE  US  LOSE  OUR  PRIMALITY,  AND  THUS  OUR  DIVINITY

SOME  WISDOM

AMASS  GREAT  WEALTH

NEVER  BECOME  ATTACHED  TO  WHAT  YOU  OWN

BE  PREPARED  TO  DESTROY  ALL  THAT  YOU  OWN


AN  INSTRUCTION

PROGRAM  YOUR  MIND

PROGRAM  REALITY

```

[Page 14](img/14.jpg)

```

A  KOAN

DURING  A  LESSON,  THE  MASTER  EXPLAINED  THE  I

"THE  I  IS  THE  VOICE  OF  THE  CIRCUMFERENCE,"  HE  SAID

WHEN  ASKED  BY  A  STUDENT  TO  EXPLAIN  WHAT  THAT  MEANT;  THE  MASTER  SAID  "IT  IS  A  VOICE  INSIDE  YOUR  HEAD"

"I  DON'T  HAVE  A  VOICE  IN  MY  HEAD,"  THOUGHT  THE  STUDENT,  AND  HE  RAISED  HIS  HAND  TO  TELL  THE  MASTER

THE  MASTER  STOP

```

[Page 15](img/15.jpg)

```

PED  THE  STUDENT,  AND  SAID  "THE  VOICE  THAT  JUST  SAID  YOU  HAVE  NO  VOICE  IN  YOUR  HEAD;  IS  THE  I"

AND  THE  STUDENTS  WERE  ENLIGHTENED

```

[06:36] <azzy23: In the square & compass symbol, there is a G in the middle. The G is a Ghemel, which is representative of god, and carries the numeric value of 3

[06:36] <azzy23: both of the Blake hands are holding a compass.

[06:37] <azzy23: The one on top comes from a painting of Newton, the one on bottom is god... science above faith.

[06:37] <azzy23: The hands on the sides are from the painting Nebechenezzur, which represents the fall into man's bestial nature

[06:37] <cydoniac: Where are you seeing that symbol?

[06:37] <BlueFox: yes, they are, but if you overlay onto the matrix page, the finger points 
somewhere, no?

[06:37] <TaiiwoBot: ^ SQUARE AND COMPASSES - Freemasonry's Logo http://tinyurl.com/pqw9j3q ^

[06:38] <azzy23: if you take the Blake painting into paint or something, draw in the lines

[06:38] <L4T1V3: yeah the second line

[06:38] <azzy23: it looks like the square & compass, sans the G

[06:38] <azzy23: the finger is pointing to the middle, where the G would be

[06:38] <azzy23: and the G represents the number 3, in numerology

[06:38] <azzy23: (it's god, and god is always 3)

Isaac Newton is shown sitting naked and crouched on a rocky outcropping covered with algae, apparently at the bottom of the sea. His attention is focused upon diagrams he draws with a compass upon a scroll. The compass is a smaller version of that held by Urizen in Blake's The Ancient of Days.
